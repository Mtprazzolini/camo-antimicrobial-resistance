Project 3: Assessing the prevalence of antimicrobials, drug-resistant organisms and resistant genes in urban water supplies and wastewater and to estimate the impact of the stewardship interventions.
Objective: Within phase one of project three, we will address important knowledge gaps on the prevalence and impact of AMR/antimicrobial usage in urbanised, deprived communities by, (i) evaluating levels of key antimicrobial agents, including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and meropenem; and (ii) estimating the prevalence of drug resistant organisms within drinking water, wastewater and stream water collected from the metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP).
